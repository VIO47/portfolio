              developer eager to broaden my horizons. I'm passionate about the

              user research, coming up with designs, or bringing ideas to life

              I am always eager to learn and improve my skills. In my spare
              time, I play around in Figma and read about UX principles and best
              practices, expanding my knowledge of user-centered design and how
              it influences digital experiences.
